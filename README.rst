IPnext - Editable Footer, for Plone 4
=====================================


Introduction
============

This product replaces Plone's standard footer with one that is editable in the
Plone Control Panel, through a WYSIWYG text box, by the Site Administrator.

This product is for use cases where you want to give Site Admins the
possibility of easily editing the footer without installing products which
increase the complexity of the user interface, like ContentWellPortlets.

Installation
============

See docs/INSTALL.txt


Usage
=====

Install the product by going to the Add-on products configlet, selecting the
EditableFooter product, and clicking on 'Activate.

Go back to the Plone Control Panel/ Site setup screen and a new entry should be
present in the Add on Configuration section, called 'Footer settings'.


Overview
========

A new footer viewlet replaces the old, static one. The formatted text is stored
in the Plone Registry.
